008.02@en His name, however, is Meletus, I believe.

010.03@grc τὸ γὰρ νέον ὄντα τοσοῦτον πρᾶγμα ἐγνωκέναι οὐ φαῦλόν ἐστιν.

010.05@en He must be a wise man; who, seeing my lack of wisdom and that I am corrupting his fellows, comes to the State, as a boy runs to his mother, to accuse me.
010.06@grc καὶ φαίνεταί μοι τῶν πολιτικῶν {2d} μόνος ἄρχεσθαι ὀρθῶς·
010.06@en And he seems to me to be the only one of the public men who begins in the right way;

010.07@en for the right way is to take care of the young men first, to make them as good as possible, just as a good husbandman will naturally take care of the young plants first and afterwards of the rest.

011.01@en And so Meletus, perhaps, is first clearing away us who corrupt the young plants, as he says;

014.00 ΕΥΘ.
014.01@grc μανθάνω, ὦ Σώκρατες·

014.02@grc ὅτι δὴ σὺ τὸ δαιμόνιον φῂς σαυτῷ ἑκάστοτε γίγνεσθαι.
014.02@en it is because you say the divine monitor keeps coming to you.

014.03@en So he has brought the indictment against you for making innovations in religion, and he is going into court to slander you, knowing that slanders on such subjects are readily accepted by the people.
014.04@grc καὶ ἐμοῦ γάρ τοι, {3c} ὅταν τι λέγω ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ περὶ τῶν θείων, προλέγων αὐτοῖς τὰ μέλλοντα, καταγελῶσιν ὡς μαινομένου·

017.02@en But I fear that because of my love of men they think that I not only pour myself out copiously to anyone and everyone without payment, but that I would even pay something myself, if anyone would listen to me.
017.03@grc εἰ μὲν οὖν, ὃ νυνδὴ ἔλεγον, μέλλοιέν μου καταγελᾶν ὥσπερ {3e} σὺ φῂς σαυτοῦ, οὐδὲν ἂν εἴη ἀηδὲς παίζοντας καὶ γελῶντας ἐν τῷ δικαστηρίῳ διαγαγεῖν·
017.03@en Now if, as I was saying just now, they were to laugh at me, as you say they do at you, it would not be at all unpleasant to pass the time in the court with jests and laughter;

034.01@en It is ridiculous, Socrates, that you think it matters whether the man who was killed was a stranger or a relative, and do not see that the only thing to consider is whether the action of the slayer was justified or not, and that if it was justified one ought to let him alone, and if not, one ought to proceed against him, even if he share one’s hearth and eat at one’s table.
034.02@grc ἴσον γὰρ τὸ μίασμα γίγνεται ἐὰν συνῇς τῷ τοιούτῳ συνειδὼς καὶ μὴ ἀφοσιοῖς σεαυτόν τε καὶ ἐκεῖνον τῇ δίκῃ ἐπεξιών.

034.03@grc ἐπεὶ ὅ γε ἀποθανὼν πελάτης τις ἦν ἐμός, καὶ ὡς ἐγεωργοῦμεν ἐν τῇ Νάξῳ, ἐθήτευεν ἐκεῖ παρ’ ἡμῖν.

034.04@grc παροινήσας οὖν καὶ ὀργισθεὶς τῶν οἰκετῶν τινι τῶν ἡμετέρων ἀποσφάττει αὐτόν.

034.05@en So my father bound him hand and foot, threw him into a ditch, and sent a man here to Athens to ask the religious adviser what he ought to do.
034.06@grc ἐν δὲ τούτῳ τῷ χρόνῳ τοῦ δεδεμένου ὠλιγώρει τε καὶ ἠμέλει ὡς ἀνδροφόνου καὶ οὐδὲν ὂν πρᾶγμα εἰ καὶ ἀποθάνοι, ὅπερ οὖν καὶ ἔπαθεν·
034.06@en In the meantime he paid no attention to the man as he lay there bound, and neglected him, thinking that he was a murderer and it did not matter if he were to die. And that is just what happened to him.

034.08@en Now my father and the rest of my relatives are angry with me, because for the sake of this murderer I am prosecuting my father for murder. For they say he did not kill him, and if he had killed him never so much, yet since the dead man was a murderer, I ought not to trouble myself about such a fellow,
034.09@grc ἀνόσιον {4e} γὰρ εἶναι τὸ ὑὸν πατρὶ φόνου ἐπεξιέναι —

035.01@en But, in the name of Zeus, Euthyphro, do you think your knowledge about divine laws and holiness and unholiness is so exact that, when the facts are as you say, you are not afraid of doing something unholy yourself in prosecuting your father for murder?

037.01@en Then the best thing for me, my admirable Euthyphro, is to become your pupil and, before the suit with Meletus comes on, to challenge him and say that I always thought it very important before to know about divine matters and that now, since he says I am doing wrong by acting carelessly and making innovations in matters of religion, I have become your pupil.

039.03@grc ἢ οὐ ταὐτόν ἐστιν ἐν πάσῃ πράξει τὸ ὅσιον αὐτὸ αὑτῷ, καὶ τὸ ἀνόσιον αὖ τοῦ μὲν ὁσίου παντὸς ἐναντίον, αὐτὸ δὲ αὑτῷ ὅμοιον καὶ ἔχον μίαν τινὰ ἰδέαν κατὰ τὴν ἀνοσιότητα πᾶν ὅτιπερ ἂν μέλλῃ ἀνόσιον εἶναι;
039.03@en Is not holiness always the same with itself in every action and, on the other hand, is not unholiness the opposite of all holiness, always the same with itself and whatever is to be unholy possessing some one characteristic quality?

042.00 ΕΥΘ.
042.01@grc λέγω τοίνυν ὅτι τὸ μὲν ὅσιόν ἐστιν ὅπερ ἐγὼ νῦν ποιῶ, τῷ ἀδικοῦντι ἢ περὶ φόνους ἢ περὶ ἱερῶν κλοπὰς ἤ τι ἄλλο τῶν τοιούτων ἐξαμαρτάνοντι ἐπεξιέναι, ἐάντε πατὴρ {5e} ὢν τυγχάνῃ ἐάντε μήτηρ ἐάντε ἄλλος ὁστισοῦν, τὸ δὲ μὴ ἐπεξιέναι ἀνόσιον·
042.01@en Well then, I say that holiness is doing what I am doing now, prosecuting the wrongdoer who commits murder or steals from the temples or does any such thing, whether he be your father, or your mother or anyone else, and not prosecuting him is unholy. 
042.02@grc ἐπεί, ὦ Σώκρατες, θέασαι ὡς μέγα σοι ἐρῶ τεκμήριον τοῦ νόμου ὅτι οὕτως ἔχει —
042.02@en And, Socrates, see what a sure proof I offer you, —

042.04@grc μὴ ἐπιτρέπειν τῷ ἀσεβοῦντι μηδ’ ἂν ὁστισοῦν τυγχάνῃ ὤν.
042.04@en and that we ought not to let him who acts impiously go unpunished, no matter who he may be.
042.05@grc αὐτοὶ γὰρ οἱ ἄνθρωποι τυγχάνουσι νομίζοντες τὸν Δία τῶν θεῶν ἄριστον καὶ δικαιότατον, {6a} καὶ τοῦτον ὁμολογοῦσι τὸν αὑτοῦ πατέρα δῆσαι ὅτι τοὺς ὑεῖς κατέπινεν οὐκ ἐν δίκῃ, κἀκεῖνόν γε αὖ τὸν αὑτοῦ πατέρα ἐκτεμεῖν δι’ ἕτερα τοιαῦτα·
042.05@en Men believe that Zeus is the best and most just of the gods, and they acknowledge that he put his father in bonds because he wickedly devoured his children, and he in turn had mutilated his father for similar reasons;
042.06@grc ἐμοὶ δὲ χαλεπαίνουσιν ὅτι τῷ πατρὶ ἐπεξέρχομαι ἀδικοῦντι, καὶ οὕτως αὐτοὶ αὑτοῖς τὰ ἐναντία λέγουσι περί τε τῶν θεῶν καὶ περὶ ἐμοῦ.
042.06@en but they are incensed against me because I proceed against my father when he has done wrong, and so they are inconsistent in what they say about the gods and about me.

043.01@grc ἆρά γε, ὦ Εὐθύφρων, τοῦτ’ ἔστιν {del} οὗ {/del} οὕνεκα τὴν γραφὴν φεύγω, ὅτι τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐπειδάν τις περὶ τῶν θεῶν λέγῃ, δυσχερῶς πως ἀποδέχομαι;
043.01@en Is not this, Euthyphro, the reason why I am being prosecuted, because when people tell such stories about the gods I find it hard to accept them?
043.02@grc διὸ δή, ὡς ἔοικε, φήσει τίς με ἐξαμαρτάνειν.
043.02@en And therefore, probably, people will say I am wrong.

043.04@grc τί γὰρ καὶ φήσομεν, οἵ γε καὶ αὐτοὶ ὁμολογοῦμεν περὶ αὐτῶν μηδὲν εἰδέναι;

045.01@en And so you believe that there was really war between the gods, and fearful enmities and battles and other things of the sort, such as are told of by the poets and represented in varied designs by the great artists in our sacred places and especially on the robe which is carried up to the Acropolis at the great Panathenaea? for this is covered with such representations.

051.02@grc ἔφησθα γάρ που μιᾷ ἰδέᾳ {6e} τά τε ἀνόσια ἀνόσια εἶναι καὶ τὰ ὅσια ὅσια·

085.04@en And so, Euthyphro, it would not be surprising if, in punishing your father as you are doing, you were performing an act that is pleasing to Zeus, but hateful to Cronus and Uranus, and pleasing to Hephaestus, but hateful to Hera, and so forth in respect to the other gods, if any disagree with any other about it.

093.01@en Then they do not argue this point, that the wrongdoer must not pay the penalty; but perhaps they argue about this, who is a wrongdoer, and what he did, and when.

094.00 ΕΥΘ.
094.01@grc ἀληθῆ λέγεις.
094.01@en That is true.

095.01@en Then is not the same thing true of the gods, if they quarrel about right and wrong, as you say, and some say others have done wrong, and some say they have not?
095.02@grc ἐπεὶ ἐκεῖνό γε δήπου, ὦ θαυμάσιε, οὐδεὶς οὔτε θεῶν οὔτε {8e} ἀνθρώπων τολμᾷ λέγειν, ὡς οὐ τῷ γε ἀδικοῦντι δοτέον δίκην.

097.01@en But I think, Euthyphro, those who dispute, both men and gods, if the gods do dispute, dispute about each separate act.
097.02@grc πράξεώς τινος πέρι διαφερόμενοι οἱ μὲν δικαίως φασὶν αὐτὴν πεπρᾶχθαι, οἱ δὲ ἀδίκως·

099.01@en Come now, my dear Euthyphro, inform me, that I may be made wiser, what proof you have that all the gods think that the man lost his life wrongfully, who, when he was a servant, committed murder, was bound by the master of the man he killed, and died as a result of his bonds before the master who had bound him found out from the advisers what he ought to do with him, and that it is right on account of such a man for a son to proceed against his father and accuse him of murder.

101.02@en it is because you think I am slower to understand than the judges; since it is plain that you will show them that such acts are wrong and that all the gods hate them.

102.00 ΕΥΘ.
102.01@grc πάνυ γε σαφῶς, ὦ Σώκρατες, ἐάνπερ ἀκούωσί γέ μου λέγοντος.

103.03@grc τόδε δέ σου ἐνενόησα ἅμα λέγοντος καὶ πρὸς ἐμαυτὸν σκοπῶ·
103.03@en But this occurred to me while you were talking, and I said to myself:
103.04@grc {q} εἰ ὅτι μάλιστά με Εὐθύφρων διδάξειεν ὡς οἱ θεοὶ ἅπαντες τὸν τοιοῦτον θάνατον ἡγοῦνται ἄδικον εἶναι, τί μᾶλλον ἐγὼ μεμάθηκα παρ’ Εὐθύφρονος τί ποτ’ ἐστὶν τὸ ὅσιόν τε καὶ τὸ ἀνόσιον;
103.04@en {q} If Euthyphro should prove to me no matter how clearly that all the gods think such a death is wrongful, what have I learned from Euthyphro about the question, what is holiness and what is unholiness?
103.05@grc θεομισὲς μὲν γὰρ τοῦτο τὸ ἔργον, ὡς ἔοικεν, εἴη ἄν.
103.05@en For this act would, as it seems, be hateful to the gods;
103.06@grc ἀλλὰ γὰρ οὐ τούτῳ ἐφάνη ἄρτι ὡρισμένα τὸ ὅσιον καὶ μή·
103.06@en but we saw just now that holiness and its opposite are not defined in this way; 
103.07@grc τὸ γὰρ θεομισὲς ὂν καὶ θεοφιλὲς ἐφάνη. {/q}
103.07@en for we saw that what is hateful to the gods is also dear to them; {/q}
103.08@grc ὥστε τούτου μὲν ἀφίημί σε, ὦ Εὐθύφρων·

103.11@en that whatever all the gods hate is unholy and whatever they all love is holy,
103.12@grc ὃ δ’ ἂν οἱ μὲν φιλῶσιν οἱ δὲ μισῶσιν, οὐδέτερα ἢ ἀμφότερα —

107.01@en Then shall we examine this again, Euthyphro, to see if it is correct, or shall we let it go and accept our own statement, and those of others, agreeing that it is so, if anyone merely says that it is?
107.02@grc ἢ σκεπτέον τί λέγει ὁ λέγων;

119.06@grc οὐδ’ ὅτι πάσχον ἐστὶ πάσχει, ἀλλ’ ὅτι πάσχει πάσχον ἐστίν·

139.01@en But if that which is dear to the gods and that which is holy were identical, my dear Euthyphro, then if the holy were loved because it is holy, that which is dear to the gods would be loved because it is dear, and if that which is dear to the gods is dear because it is loved, then that which is holy would be holy because it is loved; 
139.02@grc νῦν δὲ ὁρᾷς ὅτι ἐναντίως ἔχετον, ὡς παντάπασιν ἑτέρω ὄντε ἀλλήλων.

139.03@grc τὸ μὲν γάρ, ὅτι φιλεῖται, ἐστὶν οἷον φιλεῖσθαι·

139.04@grc τὸ δ’ ὅτι ἐστὶν οἷον φιλεῖσθαι, διὰ τοῦτο φιλεῖται.

139.05@en And, Euthyphro, it seems that when you were asked what holiness is you were unwilling to make plain its essence, but you mentioned something that has happened to this holiness, namely, that it is loved by the gods.
139.06@grc ὅτι δὲ ὄν, οὔπω εἶπες.

139.08@grc οὐ γὰρ περὶ τούτου διοισόμεθα —

143.01@en Apparently then, my friend, I am a more clever artist than Daedalus, inasmuch as he made only his own works move, whereas I, as it seems, give motion to the works of others as well as to my own.
143.02@grc καὶ δῆτα τοῦτό μοι τῆς τέχνης ἐστὶ κομψότατον, ὅτι ἄκων εἰμὶ σοφός·
143.02@en And the most exquisite thing about my art is that I am clever against my will;
143.03@grc ἐβουλόμην γὰρ ἄν μοι τοὺς λόγους μένειν καὶ ἀκινήτως ἱδρῦσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ πρὸς τῇ {11e} Δαιδάλου σοφίᾳ τὰ Ταντάλου χρήματα γενέσθαι.

147.05@grc λέγω γὰρ δὴ τὸ ἐναντίον ἢ ὁ ποιητὴς ἐποίησεν ὁ ποιήσας —
147.05@en What I mean is the opposite of what the poet said, who wrote:

149.01@en It does not seem to me true that where fear is, there also is reverence; for many who fear diseases and poverty and other such things seem to me to fear, but not to reverence at all these things which they fear.
149.02@grc οὐ καὶ σοὶ δοκεῖ;

153.03@grc ἐπὶ πλέον γὰρ οἶμαι δέος αἰδοῦς.
153.03@en since, as I think, fear is more comprehensive than reverence;
153.04@grc μόριον γὰρ αἰδὼς δέους ὥσπερ ἀριθμοῦ περιττόν, ὥστε οὐχ ἵναπερ ἀριθμὸς ἔνθα καὶ περιττόν, ἵνα δὲ περιττὸν ἔνθα καὶ ἀριθμός.
153.04@en for reverence is a part of fear, just as the odd is a part of number, so that it is not true that where number is, there also is the odd, but that where the odd is, there also is number.

160.01@en This then is my opinion, Socrates, that the part of the right which has to do with attention to the gods constitutes piety and holiness, and that the remaining part of the right is that which has to do with the service of men.

203.01@en You might, if you wished, Euthyphro, have answered much more briefly the chief part of my question.
203.02@grc ἀλλὰ γὰρ οὐ {14c} πρόθυμός με εἶ διδάξαι —
203.02@en But it is plain that you do not care to instruct me.
203.03@grc δῆλος εἶ.
203.03@en 
203.04@grc καὶ γὰρ νῦν ἐπειδὴ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ ἦσθα ἀπετράπου, ὃ εἰ ἀπεκρίνω, ἱκανῶς ἂν ἤδη παρὰ σοῦ τὴν ὁσιότητα ἐμεμαθήκη.
203.04@en For now, when you were close upon it you turned aside; and if you had answered it, I should already have obtained from you all the instruction I need about holiness.
203.05@grc νῦν δὲ ἀνάγκη γὰρ τὸν ἐρῶντα τῷ ἐρωμένῳ ἀκολουθεῖν ὅπῃ ἂν ἐκεῖνος ὑπάγῃ, τί δὴ αὖ λέγεις τὸ ὅσιον εἶναι καὶ τὴν ὁσιότητα;
203.05@en But, as things are, the questioner must follow the one questioned wherever he leads. What do you say the holy, or holiness, is?
203.06@grc οὐχὶ ἐπιστήμην τινὰ τοῦ θύειν τε καὶ εὔχεσθαι;
203.06@en Do you not say that it is a kind of science of sacrificing and praying?

204.00 ΕΥΘ.
204.01@grc ἔγωγε.
204.01@en Yes.

205.00 ΣΩ.
205.01@grc οὐκοῦν τὸ θύειν δωρεῖσθαί ἐστι τοῖς θεοῖς, τὸ δ’ εὔχεσθαι αἰτεῖν τοὺς θεούς;
205.01@en And sacrificing is making gifts to the gods and praying is asking from them?

206.00 ΕΥΘ.
206.01@grc καὶ μάλα, ὦ Σώκρατες.
206.01@en Exactly, Socrates.

207.00 {14d} ΣΩ.
207.01@grc ἐπιστήμη ἄρα αἰτήσεως καὶ δόσεως θεοῖς ὁσιότης ἂν εἴη ἐκ τούτου τοῦ λόγου.
207.01@en Then holiness, according to this definition, would be a science of giving and asking.

208.00 ΕΥΘ.
208.01@grc πάνυ καλῶς, ὦ Σώκρατες, συνῆκας ὃ εἶπον.
208.01@en You understand perfectly what I said, Socrates.

209.00 ΣΩ.
209.01@grc ἐπιθυμητὴς γάρ εἰμι, ὦ φίλε, τῆς σῆς σοφίας καὶ προσέχω τὸν νοῦν αὐτῇ, ὥστε οὐ χαμαὶ πεσεῖται ὅτι ἂν εἴπῃς.
209.01@en Yes, my friend, for I am eager for your wisdom, and give my mind to it, so that nothing you say shall fall to the ground.
209.02@grc ἀλλά μοι λέξον τίς αὕτη ἡ ὑπηρεσία ἐστὶ τοῖς θεοῖς;
209.02@en But tell me, what is this service of the gods?
209.03@grc αἰτεῖν τε φῂς αὐτοὺς καὶ διδόναι ἐκείνοις;
209.03@en Do you say that it consists in asking from them and giving to them?

210.00 ΕΥΘ.
210.01@grc ἔγωγε.
210.01@en Yes.

211.00 ΣΩ.
211.01@grc ἆρ’ οὖν οὐ τό γε ὀρθῶς αἰτεῖν ἂν εἴη ὧν δεόμεθα παρ’ ἐκείνων, ταῦτα αὐτοὺς αἰτεῖν;
211.01@en Would not the right way of asking be to ask of them what we need from them?

212.00 ΕΥΘ.
212.01@grc ἀλλὰ τί;
212.01@en What else?

213.00 {14e} ΣΩ.
213.01@grc καὶ αὖ τὸ διδόναι ὀρθῶς, ὧν ἐκεῖνοι τυγχάνουσιν δεόμενοι παρ’ ἡμῶν, ταῦτα ἐκείνοις αὖ ἀντιδωρεῖσθαι;
213.01@en And the right way of giving, to present them with what they need from us?
213.02@grc οὐ γάρ που τεχνικόν γ’ ἂν εἴη δωροφορεῖν διδόντα τῳ ταῦτα ὧν οὐδὲν δεῖται.
213.02@en For it would not be scientific giving to give anyone what he does not need.

214.00 ΕΥΘ.
214.01@grc ἀληθῆ λέγεις, ὦ Σώκρατες.
214.01@en You are right, Socrates.

215.00 ΣΩ.
215.01@grc ἐμπορικὴ ἄρα τις ἂν εἴη, ὦ Εὐθύφρων, τέχνη ἡ ὁσιότης θεοῖς καὶ ἀνθρώποις παρ’ ἀλλήλων.
215.01@en Then holiness would be an art of barter between gods and men?

216.00 ΕΥΘ.
216.01@grc ἐμπορική, εἰ οὕτως ἥδιόν σοι ὀνομάζειν.
216.01@en Yes, of barter, if you like to call it so.

217.00 ΣΩ.
217.01@grc ἀλλ’ οὐδὲν ἥδιον ἔμοιγε, εἰ μὴ τυγχάνει ἀληθὲς ὄν.
217.01@en I don’t like to call it so, if it is not true.
217.02@grc φράσον δέ μοι, τίς ἡ ὠφελία τοῖς θεοῖς τυγχάνει οὖσα ἀπὸ τῶν δώρων ὧν παρ’ ἡμῶν λαμβάνουσιν;
217.02@en But tell me, what advantage accrues to the gods from the gifts they get from us?
217.03@grc ἃ μὲν γὰρ διδόασι {15a} παντὶ δῆλον·
217.03@en For everybody knows what they give,
217.04@grc οὐδὲν γὰρ ἡμῖν ἐστιν ἀγαθὸν ὅτι ἂν μὴ ἐκεῖνοι δῶσιν.
217.04@en since we have nothing good which they do not give.
217.05@grc ἃ δὲ παρ’ ἡμῶν λαμβάνουσιν, τί ὠφελοῦνται;
217.05@en But what advantage do they derive from what they get from us?
217.06@grc ἢ τοσοῦτον αὐτῶν πλεονεκτοῦμεν κατὰ τὴν ἐμπορίαν, ὥστε πάντα τὰ ἀγαθὰ παρ’ αὐτῶν λαμβάνομεν, ἐκεῖνοι δὲ παρ’ ἡμῶν οὐδέν;
217.06@en Or have we so much the better of them in our bartering that we get all good things from them and they nothing from us?

218.00 ΕΥΘ.
218.01@grc ἀλλ’ οἴει, ὦ Σώκρατες, τοὺς θεοὺς ὠφελεῖσθαι ἀπὸ τούτων ἃ παρ’ ἡμῶν λαμβάνουσιν;
218.01@en Why you don’t suppose, Socrates, that the gods gain any advantage from what they get from us, do you?

219.00 ΣΩ.
219.01@grc ἀλλὰ τί δήποτ’ ἂν εἴη ταῦτα, ὦ Εὐθύφρων, τὰ παρ’ ἡμῶν δῶρα τοῖς θεοῖς;
219.01@en Well then, what would those gifts of ours to the gods be?

220.00 ΕΥΘ.
220.01@grc τί δ’ οἴει ἄλλο ἢ τιμή τε καὶ γέρα καί, ὅπερ ἐγὼ ἄρτι ἔλεγον, χάρις;
220.01@en What else than honor and praise, and, as I said before, gratitude?

221.00 {15b} ΣΩ.
221.01@grc κεχαρισμένον ἄρα ἐστίν, ὦ Εὐθύφρων, τὸ ὅσιον, ἀλλ’ οὐχὶ ὠφέλιμον οὐδὲ φίλον τοῖς θεοῖς;
221.01@en Then, Euthyphro, holiness is grateful to the gods, but not advantageous or precious to the gods?

222.00 ΕΥΘ.
222.01@grc οἶμαι ἔγωγε πάντων γε μάλιστα φίλον.
222.01@en I think it is precious, above all things.

223.00 ΣΩ.
223.01@grc τοῦτο ἄρ’ ἐστὶν αὖ, ὡς ἔοικε, τὸ ὅσιον, τὸ τοῖς θεοῖς φίλον.
223.01@en Then again, it seems, holiness is that which is precious to the gods.

224.00 ΕΥΘ.
224.01@grc μάλιστά γε.
224.01@en Certainly.

225.00 ΣΩ.
225.01@grc θαυμάσῃ οὖν ταῦτα λέγων ἐάν σοι οἱ λόγοι φαίνωνται μὴ μένοντες ἀλλὰ βαδίζοντες, καὶ ἐμὲ αἰτιάσῃ τὸν Δαίδαλον βαδίζοντας αὐτοὺς ποιεῖν, αὐτὸς ὢν πολύ γε τεχνικώτερος τοῦ Δαιδάλου καὶ κύκλῳ περιιόντα ποιῶν;
225.01@en Then will you be surprised, since you say this, if your words do not remain fixed but walk about, and will you accuse me of being the Daedalus who makes them walk, when you are yourself much more skilful than Daedalus and make them go round in a circle?
225.02@grc ἢ οὐκ αἰσθάνῃ ὅτι ὁ λόγος ἡμῖν περιελθὼν πάλιν εἰς ταὐτὸν {15c} ἥκει;
225.02@en Or do you not see that our definition has come round to the point from which it started?
225.03@grc μέμνησαι γάρ που ὅτι ἐν τῷ πρόσθεν τό τε ὅσιον καὶ τὸ θεοφιλὲς οὐ ταὐτὸν ἡμῖν ἐφάνη ἀλλ’ ἕτερα ἀλλήλων·
225.03@en For you remember, I suppose, that a while ago we found that holiness and what is dear to the gods were not the same, but different from each other;
225.04@grc ἢ οὐ μέμνησαι;
225.04@en or do you not remember?

226.00 ΕΥΘ.
226.01@grc ἔγωγε.
226.01@en Yes, I remember.

227.00 ΣΩ.
227.01@grc νῦν οὖν οὐκ ἐννοεῖς ὅτι τὸ τοῖς θεοῖς φίλον φῂς ὅσιον εἶναι;
227.01@en Then don’t you see that now you say that what is precious to the gods is holy?
227.02@grc τοῦτο δ’ ἄλλο τι ἢ θεοφιλὲς γίγνεται;
227.02@en And is not this what is dear to the gods?
227.03@grc ἢ οὔ;
227.03@en

228.00 ΕΥΘ.
228.01@grc πάνυ γε.
228.01@en Certainly.

229.00 ΣΩ.
229.01@grc οὐκοῦν ἢ ἄρτι οὐ καλῶς ὡμολογοῦμεν, ἢ εἰ τότε καλῶς, νῦν οὐκ ὀρθῶς τιθέμεθα.
229.01@en Then either our agreement a while ago was wrong, or if that was right, we are wrong now.

230.00 ΕΥΘ.
230.01@grc ἔοικεν.
230.01@en So it seems.


231.00 ΣΩ.
231.01@grc ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἄρα ἡμῖν πάλιν σκεπτέον τί ἐστι τὸ ὅσιον, ὡς ἐγὼ πρὶν ἂν μάθω ἑκὼν εἶναι οὐκ ἀποδειλιάσω.
231.01@en Then we must begin again at the beginning and ask what holiness is. Since I shall not willingly give up until I learn.
231.02@grc {15d} ἀλλὰ μή με ἀτιμάσῃς ἀλλὰ παντὶ τρόπῳ προσσχὼν τὸν νοῦν ὅτι μάλιστα νῦν εἰπὲ τὴν ἀλήθειαν·
231.02@en And do not scorn me, but by all means apply your mind now to the utmost and tell me the truth;
231.03@grc οἶσθα γὰρ εἴπερ τις ἄλλος ἀνθρώπων, καὶ οὐκ ἀφετέος εἶ ὥσπερ ὁ Πρωτεὺς πρὶν ἂν εἴπῃς.
231.03@en for you know, if anyone does, and like Proteus, you must be held until you speak.
231.04@grc εἰ γὰρ μὴ ᾔδησθα σαφῶς τό τε ὅσιον καὶ τὸ ἀνόσιον, οὐκ ἔστιν ὅπως ἄν ποτε ἐπεχείρησας ὑπὲρ ἀνδρὸς θητὸς ἄνδρα πρεσβύτην πατέρα διωκάθειν φόνου, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς θεοὺς ἂν ἔδεισας παρακινδυνεύειν μὴ οὐκ ὀρθῶς αὐτὸ ποιήσοις, καὶ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ᾐσχύνθης·
231.04@en For if you had not clear knowledge of holiness and unholiness, you would surely not have undertaken to prosecute your aged father for murder for the sake of a servant. You would have been afraid to risk the anger of the gods, in case your conduct should be wrong, and would have been ashamed in the sight of men.
231.05@grc νῦν δὲ εὖ οἶδα ὅτι {15e} σαφῶς οἴει εἰδέναι τό τε ὅσιον καὶ μή.
231.05@en But now I am sure you think you know what is holy and what is not.
231.06@grc εἰπὲ οὖν, ὦ βέλτιστε Εὐθύφρων, καὶ μὴ ἀποκρύψῃ ὅτι αὐτὸ ἡγῇ.
231.06@en So tell me, most excellent Euthyphro, and do not conceal your thought.

232.00 ΕΥΘ.
232.01@grc εἰς αὖθις τοίνυν, ὦ Σώκρατες·
232.01@en Some other time.
232.02@grc νῦν γὰρ σπεύδω ποι, καί μοι ὥρα ἀπιέναι.
232.02@en Now I am in a hurry and it is time for me to go.

233.00 ΣΩ.
233.01@grc οἷα ποιεῖς, ὦ ἑταῖρε.
233.01@en Oh my friend, what are you doing? 
233.02@grc ἀπ’ ἐλπίδος με καταβαλὼν μεγάλης ἀπέρχῃ ἣν εἶχον, ὡς παρὰ σοῦ μαθὼν τά τε ὅσια καὶ μὴ καὶ τῆς πρὸς Μέλητον γραφῆς ἀπαλλάξομαι, ἐνδειξάμενος {16a} ἐκείνῳ ὅτι σοφὸς ἤδη παρ’ Εὐθύφρονος τὰ θεῖα γέγονα καὶ ὅτι οὐκέτι ὑπ’ ἀγνοίας αὐτοσχεδιάζω οὐδὲ καινοτομῶ περὶ αὐτά, καὶ δὴ καὶ τὸν ἄλλον βίον ὅτι ἄμεινον βιωσοίμην.
233.02@en You go away and leave me cast down from the high hope I had that I should learn from you what is holy, and what is not, and should get rid of Meletus’s indictment by showing him that I have been made wise by Euthyphro about divine matters and am no longer through ignorance acting carelessly and making innovations in respect to them, and that I shall live a better life henceforth.
